# AutoRender for CSGO
Automatic fragclip renderer for CS:GO.

# How does it work?
- Telnet: CS:GO has a built-in Telnet-Server that can be used to remotelly control the game via telnet.
- GSI: Game State Integrator, this can be used to detect when a certain player gets killed and when the round is over and more...
